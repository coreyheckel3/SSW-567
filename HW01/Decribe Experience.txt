I thought this assignment went well. I have not used python in about a year so I had to refresh my memory with the syntax. 
Other than that I did not experience any issues or concerns.I did not encounter any challenges with this assignment and I thought the requirements were
clear and simple.While i have not used unit testing with python before it was very similar to javas unit testing system so I transitioned to it seamlessly
For my test cases I just picked out different types of triangles that would potentially work for a variety of options if not accounted for in the original code.
For example an equilateral triangle should not return as an isoceles even though there are two sides that are the same length. I thought this assignment was
a good example of how to utilize unit testing in python.
